A CAKE Engine that uses Graphics2d
==================================
This project is an example for us to mess with the input system API, before we lock the API. IT IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL.
To build this you first need to checkout core and switch to the input-sys-trigger branch:
```
git checkout git@github.com:metacake/core.git
cd core
git checkout input-sys-trigger
```
Then you need to build and install that branch locally:
```
mvn clean install
```
Now you can run this project.
